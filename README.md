**ti**ny **li**ttle machine learning **tool**box


Tilitools is basically a collection of (non-mainstream) machine learning model and tools 
with a special focus on anomaly detection, one-class learning, and structured data. 
Furthermore, we emphasize simplicity and ease-of-use *not* runtime performance 
(although we put some effort into optimization). Descriptive examples can be 
found in the notebooks/ and scripts/ sub-directories.
